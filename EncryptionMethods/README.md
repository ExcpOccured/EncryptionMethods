# Encryption methods

Contains the basic algorithms encrypt a message in cryptography

## Implemented methods:

### [Transopisition cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher):
Method of symmetric encryption in which elements of the source plaintext are swapped. Text elements can be individual characters (the most common case),
pairs of letters, triples of letters, a combination of these cases, and so on.
