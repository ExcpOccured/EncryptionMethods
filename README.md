# Encryption methods

Contains the basic algorithms encrypt a message in cryptography

## Implemented methods:

### Transopisition cipher:
Method of symmetric encryption in which elements of the source plaintext are swapped. Text elements can be individual characters (the most common case),
pairs of letters, triples of letters, a combination of these cases, and so on.

### Vigenère cipher
Vigenère can also be described algebraically. If the letters A–Z are taken to be the numbers 0–25 (A XOR B etc) and addition is performed modulo 26.
